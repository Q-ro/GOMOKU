# GOMOKU (A Conect 5 game by Andres Mrad (Q-ro))

## About the game

This is basically my approach to Gomoku (5 in a line), it was developed as part of a programming test for a position as a freelance programmer at GSN, in the span of about 15 hours, give or take, as I worked on it on and off from Wednesday march the 8th of 2020 to Sunday 12 of the same month and year. With this game I wanted to showcase not only my ability for dumping a bunch of code or solving a problem, but also my ability for making games in general, game design, sound design, ux and so on, it doesn't have all the features I wished to implement but I didn't wanted to delay the submission for my test and risk not being considered for the position anymore, rather, I tried to leave as much foundation work as I could to showcase all of that, and, regardless of getting hired of not, be able to have a game I could be proud of, and be able to improve, enhance and finish without it feeling unfinished but rather rough around the edges.

## Future Features

- [ ] Add the ability to select your game piece.
- [ ] Add a bit of delay between turns.
- [ ] Add better feedback to the end of the game.
- [ ] Add scene transitions.
- [ ] Add more effects in general (wanted to add sakura blossoms and more visual stuff but i couldn't find what i was looking for and implementing them in this short time was jsut out of the question).
- [ ] Add better game feel.
- [ ] Add animations to the game pieces.
- [ ] Add the ability to select a human opponent (the game can be played V.S. a human, there is just no way for the end used to access this feature, so a selection menu would be nice).
- [ ] Add the ability to select your playing piece (same as above).
- [ ] Add mobile support.
- [ ] Add the ability to play locally vs other players (probably implementing peer-to-peer or local bluetooth or wi-fi direct).
- [ ] Overall code overhaul and refactoring (There are some things I did while testing the game, that I didn't finished cleaning up, some things i could definitively implemented better, and there is also the A.I. part which, as much as i like it so far, it's nto mine and i would like to have different dificulty levels and an implementation that i can call my own).
